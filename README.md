# Internetless-Secured-Private-Chat-Room

An Arduino and RF transceiver based private chat room where two or more user can communicate securely without any internet connection.The whole project can be divided into three parts-  
  i)   Hardware Part  
  ii)  Data Encryption-Decryption  
  iii) Graphical User Interface  
  
In the hardware part, Arduino module and RF Transmitter Receiver Pair(FS1000A) are used to communicate between machines. The circuit diagram and Arduino code are provided. For secured communication, the RSA algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. A graphical user interface is also built using MATLAB to chat between machines. The whole chatting process doesn't require any internet connection.
