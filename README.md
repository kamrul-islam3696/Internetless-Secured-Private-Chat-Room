# Internetless-Secured-Private-Chat-Room

An Arduino and RF transceiver based private chat room where two or more user can communicate securely without any internet connection.
The whole project can be divided in three parts-
  i)   Hardware Part
  ii)  Data Encryption-Decryption
  iii) Graphical User Interface
  
In hardware part, arduino module and RF Transmitter Receiver Pair(FS1000A) is used to communication between machines. The circuit diagram and arduino code is provided. For secured communication, RSA algorithm is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. A graphical user interface is also built using MATLAB to chat between machines.The whole chatting process doesn't require any internet connection.
